# Chapter 19: Incident Response for Supply Chain Compromises

This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for responding to supply chain security incidents, which present unique challenges compared to traditional security breaches. Unlike conventional attacks, supply chain compromises embed malicious functionality within trusted software, using legitimate update channels and operating with the privileges of intentionally-installed applications.

The chapter begins with detection strategies, emphasizing that supply chain attacks are often discovered through indirect effects rather than direct observation. The XZ Utils and SolarWinds incidents exemplify this pattern, highlighting the need for monitoring behavioral anomalies, dependency changes, and threat intelligence from both official and community sources.

Containment strategies address the critical first hours of response, focusing on stopping deployments, revoking exposed secrets, isolating affected systems, and preserving evidence. The chapter emphasizes that supply chain containment differs fundamentally from traditional incident response because the attacker operates within your trust boundaries.

Recovery and remediation covers removing compromised dependencies, validating replacements, rebuilding systems from known-good sources, and rotating credentials at scale. The chapter stresses that rushing recovery or missing components leads to reinfection or continued exploitation through stolen credentials.

Post-incident analysis advocates for blameless post-mortems that focus on systemic improvements rather than individual blame. Root cause analysis techniques like the Five Whys help organizations identify underlying factors and implement meaningful controls.

Legal considerations round out the chapter, covering evidence preservation, notification obligations under frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA, coordination with counsel and law enforcement, and cyber insurance claims. The chapter emphasizes integrating legal and technical response from the earliest moments of an incident.
