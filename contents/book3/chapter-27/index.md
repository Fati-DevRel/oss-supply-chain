# Chapter 27: Compliance Frameworks and Standards

This chapter examines how organizations can leverage compliance frameworks and industry standards to strengthen software supply chain security. Rather than treating compliance as a checkbox exercise, the chapter demonstrates how these frameworks provide structured approaches to managing supply chain risks.

The chapter begins with OWASP standards, including the Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) which provides three progressive maturity levels for supply chain security, and the emerging Top 10 standards for LLM and Agentic AI applications that address novel risks from AI supply chains.

SOC 2 examinations, while principles-based, offer significant hooks for supply chain security through Trust Services Criteria addressing vendor management (CC9.2), change management (CC8.1), and system operations (CC7). Organizations can map SBOMs to vendor inventory requirements and frame dependency updates within change management controls.

ISO 27001:2022 provides explicit supplier relationship controls (A.5.19 through A.5.23) that directly address supply chain security. The ICT supply chain control (A.5.21) was strengthened following incidents like SolarWinds, requiring component provenance verification, vulnerability management, and transitive dependency visibility.

FedRAMP requirements, updated with NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 baselines, introduce the Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) control family. Cloud service providers must now generate SBOMs, implement supply chain risk management plans, and demonstrate component authenticity verification.

PCI DSS 4.0 brings landmark supply chain requirements for payment environments, including mandatory third-party component inventories (6.3.2) and the critical Requirement 6.4.3 mandating Content Security Policy and Subresource Integrity controls for payment page scripts to prevent Magecart-style attacks.

Across all frameworks, common themes emerge: maintain comprehensive component inventories, implement continuous vulnerability monitoring, formalize dependency change management, and prepare evidence demonstrating ongoing control effectiveness.
