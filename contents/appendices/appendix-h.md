## Appendix H: Compliance Mapping

This appendix provides mapping tables that connect the content of this book to major regulatory frameworks and compliance standards relevant to software supply chain security. Use these mappings to identify which chapters and sections address specific compliance requirements, enabling efficient audit preparation and gap analysis.

The mappings reference the chapter structure across three books. For the complete chapter listing, see each book's Table of Contents. Key topic areas:

- **Book 1: Understanding the Software Supply Chain (Ch 1-10):** Foundations—how software is built, threat landscape, historical incidents, ecosystem risks, attack patterns including malicious packages, dependency confusion, typosquatting, build attacks, insider threats, social engineering
- **Book 2: Protecting the Software Supply Chain (Ch 11-22):** Assessment & Testing—risk measurement, SBOMs, dependency management, security testing, red teaming; Defense & Response—securing dev environments, CI/CD pipelines, distribution, incident response, crisis communication; Organization—security programs, platform engineering
- **Book 3: Governing the Software Supply Chain (Ch 23-33):** People & Organizations—training, maintainer guidance, vendor risk; Regulatory—EO 14028, EU CRA, compliance frameworks, legal considerations, industry initiatives; Context—economics, geopolitics, lessons from other industries, future directions

**Chapter Reference Key:**

The mapping tables below use abbreviated chapter references (e.g., "Ch. 4.2" refers to Chapter 4, Section 2). To identify which book contains a chapter:

| Chapter Range | Book |
|---------------|------|
| Ch. 1–10 | Book 1: Understanding the Software Supply Chain |
| Ch. 11–22 | Book 2: Protecting the Software Supply Chain |
| Ch. 23–33 | Book 3: Governing the Software Supply Chain |

For example, "Ch. 11.1" refers to Book 2, Chapter 11, Section 1. Cross-reference the specific sections in the appropriate book for detailed guidance on each topic.

**Key Implementation Guidance:** Requirement 6 (secure software) maps primarily to Chapters 16-17. Requirements 12.8 (third-party management) maps to Chapter 25. Chapter 12 addresses the software inventory requirements in 6.3.2. Chapter 27 provides detailed PCI DSS 4.0 supply chain guidance including the critical Requirement 6.4.3.

**Evidence Documentation:** When preparing for audits, collect evidence demonstrating:

1. **Policy documentation** (Chapters 21, 25) – Security policies, standards, procedures
2. **Process artifacts** (Chapters 16, 17) – Code review records, test results, build logs
3. **Inventory records** (Chapter 12) – SBOMs, dependency lists, asset inventories
4. **Vulnerability records** (Chapters 12, 14) – Scan results, remediation tracking, risk assessments
5. **Third-party documentation** (Chapter 25) – Vendor assessments, contracts, monitoring records
6. **Incident records** (Chapters 19, 20) – Response plans, incident logs, post-mortems
7. **Training records** (Chapter 23) – Training completion, certifications, awareness metrics
