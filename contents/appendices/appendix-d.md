## Appendix D: Security Checklist for Open Source Projects

This appendix provides a comprehensive security checklist for open source project maintainers. Use these checklists to assess your project's security posture, identify gaps, and prioritize improvements. Each section includes implementation guidance and links to relevant resources.

The checklist aligns with the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge[^openssf-badge] criteria and incorporates recommendations from the OpenSSF Scorecard project.

For step-by-step platform walkthroughs, see **Appendix J: Platform Security Configuration Guides**, which provides complete implementation guides for GitHub and GitLab. Each checklist item below includes a reference identifier (e.g., [D.A.1]) that maps to the corresponding walkthrough in Appendix J.
