### Template Usage Notes

**Customization Guidance**

When adapting these templates:

1. **Align with existing policies**: Ensure terminology and thresholds are consistent with your organization's risk management framework and existing security policies.

2. **Adjust thresholds to risk tolerance**: The specific numbers provided (e.g., CVSS scores, remediation timelines) should be calibrated to your organization's risk appetite and operational capabilities.

3. **Consider regulatory requirements**: Modify compliance sections to address your specific regulatory environment (NIST, SOC 2, FedRAMP, industry-specific regulations).

4. **Maintain version control**: Track changes to policies and templates, especially as regulations and best practices evolve.

5. **Review periodically**: Schedule annual reviews of all policies, with interim updates when significant changes occur in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

6. **Obtain appropriate approvals**: Route policies through legal, compliance, and executive review before implementation.
